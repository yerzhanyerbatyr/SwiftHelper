p.s. look at the font of the albums, I tried to match them as much as I could.

## Find "Taylor's Version"
If you are a true swiftie, you're likely well aware of the significance of listening to songs **Taylor owns**.  

If you do not know why Taylor re-records her albums, and what does "Taylor's Version" mean - [_here is the quick guide for you_](https://www.that.legal/blog/2023/7/13/what-is-taylors-version#:~:text=Since%202021%2C%20Taylor%20Swift%20has,the%20original%20recordings%20do%20not.)!

SwiftHelper provides you with the opportunity to listen only to Taylor's songs! Just type in the name of the song, and our app will provide you with the Spotify link and QR-code.
### Type the song name here (you do not neeed to be logged in):

By the way, you do not need to write the full song title. It is not case-sensitive and it accepts mistakenly made typos.

### Enjoy listening! Also, you can see the text below that says that you can add the song to favourites, I will tell more about it later.

### In case you typed in the song that do not belong to Taylor, it will then offer you with a random song (which of course Taylor owns).
